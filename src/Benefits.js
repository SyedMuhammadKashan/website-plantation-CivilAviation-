                         <h4 className="font">Trees increase property values</h4>
                         <p>Everyone wants their home to have the highest possible property value, right? Well, landscaping with trees and plants can increase your property value by as much as 20 percent, according to some estimates. That is a great return on investment in terms of the small amount of upkeep they require</p>
                         
                         <h4 className="font">Trees clean the air</h4>
                         <p>A tree can absorb as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide each year and can sequester 1 ton of carbon dioxide by the time it reaches 40 years old. In addition, trees absorb odors and pollutant gases such as nitrogen oxides, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and ozone, and filter particulates out of the air by trapping them on their leaves and bark</p>

                        <h4 className="font">Trees slow water runoff</h4> 
                        <p>Flash flooding can be significantly reduced by planting trees. According to About.com, a Colorado Blue Spruce, either planted or growing wild, can intercept more than 1,000 gallons of water annually when fully grown, which helps recharge underground aquifers</p>
                        
                        <h4 className="font"> Trees help buffer noise pollution</h4>
                        <p>Trees that are planted at strategic points in a neighborhood or around your house can abate major noises. This is especially nice if you live near a freeway or airport</p>
                        
                        <h4 className="font">Trees are sacred</h4>
                        <p>Trees were sacred to many ancient worlds, and still hold special meaning in many cultures today. The Druids believed a number of trees to be sacred, including the Ash tree from which healing wands were made. Today, many people in Madagascar worship them because they believe their ancestor's spirits live in the forests
                            
                        </p>
                        <h4 className="font">Back to Nature</h4>
                        <p>When you feel a little low, it’s amazing how a walk in the park can do wonders. That’s because when we get in touch with nature, we reduce mental fatigue and stress, while increasing relaxation and self-esteem. Even brief exposure to nature has been shown to make us more altruistic and cooperative. This study shows touching real foliage elicits an unconscious calming effect. Other studies like the lean vs green study show where indoor plants are present, work performance increases, staff well-being improves and employees take less sick days</p>
